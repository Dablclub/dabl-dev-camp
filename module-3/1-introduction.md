# Creating Secure DeFi Frontends

### Introduction

In this module, we dive into the crucial aspects of creating secure decentralized finance (DeFi) frontends. DeFi has revolutionized the financial sector by creating an open-source, permissionless, and transparent ecosystem of financial services. Unlike traditional finance (TradFi), which relies on intermediaries like banks and brokers, DeFi leverages blockchain technology to provide financial services directly to users. We'll explore the underlying mechanisms of DeFi, the ERC-20 token standard, smart contract interactions, and utilities to handle Solidity-specific quirks.

### Recap

Before we delve deeper, let's briefly recap what we've covered so far.

In previous modules, we've set up our development environment with essential libraries such as:

- Wagmi
- Viem
- TanStack Query
- ConnectKit

We've also established wallet connections and displayed account information, and created components that enable users to interact with the blockchain, such as sending ETH.

### What will we learn?

In this module, our primary focus will be on enhancing the security and functionality of our DeFi frontend. We'll cover the following key objectives:

1. **Understanding DeFi and its mechanisms:** DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance, a movement aimed at creating an ecosystem of financial services that operate without intermediaries. DeFi applications, or dApps, run on decentralized networks, providing services like trading, lending, and borrowing directly to users. These services are powered by smart contracts—automated, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code.
2. **Ethereum wallet interactions:** A critical component of DeFi applications is the connection to a Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. This connection facilitates interactions with decentralized applications, enabling users to manage their assets and perform blockchain operations securely. Users can perform various operations using their wallets, including reading data from smart contracts and executing transactions. We'll cover both read and write operations, highlighting best practices for ensuring security and efficiency.
3. **The ERC-20 token standard:** The ERC-20 standard is widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem for creating fungible tokens. We'll discuss its significance, how it works, and why it's essential for DeFi applications.
4. **Interacting with smart contracts:** Smart contracts are the backbone of DeFi applications. We'll delve into the Application Binary Interface (ABI), which facilitates interaction with these contracts. You'll learn how to perform read operations to fetch data and write operations to execute transactions, with a focus on handling transaction confirmations and errors.
5. **Utilities for Solidity quirks:** Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, has its unique quirks. We'll introduce utility libraries and best practices to manage common issues, such as handling decimals and Ethereum addresses effectively.

### What is DeFi and How it Works Behind the Scenes

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, represents a paradigm shift in the financial industry. At its core, DeFi aims to create a financial system that is open to everyone and operates without any central authority. This is achieved through the use of blockchain technology, which ensures transparency, security, and accessibility.

In traditional finance, intermediaries like banks and brokers play a crucial role in facilitating transactions. They provide services such as lending, borrowing, and trading, but at the cost of centralization and control. DeFi eliminates these intermediaries by using smart contracts—self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. These smart contracts are deployed on decentralized networks, allowing anyone with an internet connection to access financial services.

The key components of DeFi include smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and liquidity pools. Smart contracts automate the execution of transactions, ensuring that the terms of the agreement are enforced without the need for intermediaries. dApps provide the user interface for interacting with these smart contracts, offering services like trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending on platforms like Aave and Compound. Liquidity pools, on the other hand, are pools of tokens locked in a smart contract, providing the necessary liquidity for trading on DEXs.

One of the fundamental aspects of DeFi is the use of token standards like ERC-20. The ERC-20 standard defines a set of rules that all fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain must follow, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across different DeFi platforms. Understanding this standard is crucial for interacting with tokens and integrating them into your applications.

In addition to understanding the technical aspects of DeFi, it is equally important to consider the security implications. DeFi applications are often targets for hackers due to the significant amount of value they handle. Ensuring the security of your smart contracts through rigorous testing and audits is essential to prevent vulnerabilities and protect user assets.

### Next steps

In the following lessons, we will learn how to interact with smart contracts, understanding the communication between a frontend and the EVM, the ERC-20 token standard, and some utilities to navigate the differences between the JavaScript world and the EVM bytecode.
