# React and Web3

Welcome to Module 2 of our Web3 Developer Bootcamp! In this module, we're diving into the exciting world of React and Web3. By the end of this lesson, you'll have your Next.js application up and running, connected to a Web3 wallet, and ready to interact with the blockchain.

What We'll Cover:
1. Setting Up Your Next.js Application
We'll start by getting our Next.js environment set up. If you're new to Next.js, don't worry—it's a powerful React framework that makes building complex applications a breeze. We'll walk through the steps to create a new Next.js project and structure it for Web3 development.

2. Connecting Your Web3 Wallet
One of the most important parts of any Web3 app is the wallet connection. For this, we'll use ConnectKit alongside Wagmi. ConnectKit makes it easy to connect to various wallets, and Wagmi provides the React hooks we need to interact with them. You'll see how to integrate these tools into your app and get your wallet connection up and running in no time.

3. Working with Viem and TanStack Query
To efficiently manage and interact with blockchain data, we'll use Viem and TanStack Query. Viem helps us interact with the Ethereum blockchain, while TanStack Query (formerly known as React Query) is a powerful tool for fetching and caching data in your React apps. We'll configure these libraries to allow communication between our application and the blockchain.

4. Reading Account Information
With everything set up, it’s time to execute our first blockchain reads. You'll learn how to display your wallet address, check your balance, and look up your ENS name (if you have one). This will give you a solid understanding of how to fetch and display blockchain data in your React app.

5. Creating an Outgoing Transaction
Finally, we'll walk through the process of sending an outgoing transaction. You'll learn how to send an amount of the native token (like ETH on Ethereum) from your connected wallet to another address. This is a crucial skill for any Web3 developer, as it forms the backbone of many decentralized applications.

Why This Matters:
This module is where you'll start to see the magic of Web3 in action. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a fully functional Web3-enabled React app. You'll be able to connect to a wallet, read data from the blockchain, and even send transactions. These are the building blocks you'll use throughout the rest of the bootcamp—and in many of your future Web3 projects.

So, let’s get started! Open up your code editor, fire up your terminal, and let’s begin setting up your first Web3-powered React app.

### Next Steps:

- Set up your Next.js project.
- Integrate ConnectKit and Wagmi for wallet connections.
- Set up Viem and TanStack Query for interacting with the blockchain.
- Execute your first reads and create an outgoing transaction.

Let’s build something amazing!
