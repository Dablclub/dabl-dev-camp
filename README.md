# Dabl DevCamp

## Introduction

This education series is aimed at giving Web2 developers a simplified guide to becoming dApp developers. This course is comprised of tactical skill-equipping sessions aimed at minting frontend developers as quickly as possible without focusing on smart contracts logic and backend setups.

## \*Prerequisites

**Objective**: Ensure learners have a solid foundation in specific areas before diving into Web3 development.

- **JavaScript Proficiency**: Strong understanding of JavaScript ES6+ features, asynchronous programming, and event handling.
- **React Fundamentals**: Comfortable with React basics, including components, state management, hooks, and the React lifecycle.
- **Basic Understanding of Blockchain**: While in-depth knowledge isn't required, a general understanding of blockchain concepts will be beneficial.

## Final Project

Participants will develop a frontend interface for a decentralized token exchange. This project will integrate with provided smart contracts to allow users to swap tokens directly from their wallets.

## Course structure

The first module introduces major topics in Web3, breaks down the Ethereum stack and gives an overview of the current UX in Web3 and what pain points still exist.

The second module we focus on setting the project that we will be working on for the duration of the course and demonstrates how to set up a wallet for your project, Web3 libraries like viem and wrappers like wagmi.sh and how to set up a React frontend to read and write from the blockchain.

In the third module, we will dive into the principles of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), emphasizing secure practices in frontend development and interactions with ERC-20 tokens, which are fundamental for any DeFi application. It aims to prepare developers for creating secure and efficient DeFi interfaces, particularly focusing on token handling which is crucial for the upcoming module on token swapping.

To finalize our functionality, in the fourth module we will transition from foundational DeFi concepts and secure ERC-20 token handling to practical implementation of token swapping functionality. We will explore how to integrate with existing DeFi protocols for token swapping, focusing on the use of APIs like the 0x protocol for seamless token exchanges.

Finally, a bonus module dedicated to the methodologies and tools essential for testing React applications that interact with the Ethereum blockchain, specifically through viem. The module will guide learners through configuring their testing environment, employing viem for mock blockchain interactions, and establishing best practices for robust and reliable frontend testing.

## Course Support

- **Office Hours**:
  - Office hours will be held (schedule TBA), designed to provide real-time support and answers to learners' questions.
  - During office hours, learners can ask course-related questions, seek clarification on complex topics, and receive guidance on their projects.
- **Discord Support for Students**
  - A dedicated Discord server will be established for this course, fostering a community of learning and support.
  - Channels within the server will be organized by topic and module for focused discussions, alongside general channels for broader interactions.
- **Peer Support and Collaboration**:
  - Encourage the use of the Discord server for peer support, where learners can collaborate, share resources, and offer feedback to each other.
  - Facilitate group study sessions or peer programming exercises to enhance the learning experience through collaboration.
